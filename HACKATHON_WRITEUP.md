# Construction Safety AI - Hackathon Submission

## The Problem

Construction sites are among the most dangerous work environments, accounting for 1 in 5 workplace fatalities. Traditional safety monitoring relies on manual inspections that are reactive, inconsistent, and slow to respond. By the time a safety officer identifies a hazard, it may be too late—workers are already at risk. The construction industry needs real-time, proactive hazard detection that can prevent accidents before they happen.

## Who It Helps

- **Construction Workers**: Immediate protection from life-threatening hazards
- **Site Managers**: Real-time visibility into safety compliance across multiple zones
- **Safety Officers**: Automated detection reduces inspection workload and response time
- **Insurance/Legal Teams**: Documented safety compliance and incident prevention records

## Our Solution

Construction Safety AI combines **NVIDIA Nemotron Nano 9B v2** multi-agent reasoning with vision AI to analyze construction site videos in real-time. Our hierarchical agent system features:

- **Safety Router Agent**: Coordinates hazard detection across specialized domains
- **Specialist Agents**: EMS, Fire Safety, and PPE Compliance agents with domain expertise
- **Vision Pipeline**: Gemini VLM extracts safety events from video frames
- **Tool Calling**: Automated hazard detection and site alert notifications

The system processes uploaded or recorded videos, identifies hazards (missing PPE, fire risks, medical emergencies), and provides actionable safety reports with full execution traces showing agent reasoning.

## Impact

Construction Safety AI transforms reactive safety monitoring into proactive prevention. By detecting hazards in seconds rather than hours, we enable immediate intervention that **saves lives**. The system provides 24/7 automated monitoring, reduces safety inspection costs, and creates comprehensive compliance documentation. With synthetic training data generated by OpenAI Sora 2, we enable safe testing of dangerous scenarios without putting workers at risk.

**Real-world impact**: Faster hazard detection → Earlier intervention → Prevented accidents → Lives saved.
